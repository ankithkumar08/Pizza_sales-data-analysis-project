# Pizza Sales Analysis - Excel |MySql| Power BI Dashboard 

## Project Overview üéØ
This project aims to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualize various aspects of pizza sales data using Power BI. The analysis is based on the provided dataset [`pizza_sales.csv`](https://github.com/ankithkumar08/Pizza_sales-data-analysis-project/blob/main/pizza_sales.csv), and includes key insights such as revenue trends, sales by category, and the performance of different pizzas. The visualizations help us understand the performance of the pizza business in terms of sales, order trends, and popular products.

The dashboard answers the following business questions:
- What are the total sales and revenue generated from pizza orders?
- Which pizzas are performing well in terms of revenue and quantity sold?
- What are the sales trends by day and month?
- How do different pizza categories and sizes perform in terms of sales?
